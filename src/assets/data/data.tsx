    review: `They has been a revelation for me as an independent artist R. Their completely free distribution model is unheard of in the industry, and their transparent royalty system gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm getting paid fairly for my music. I highly recommend Amuse to any artist R looking to retain full control over their work.`,
